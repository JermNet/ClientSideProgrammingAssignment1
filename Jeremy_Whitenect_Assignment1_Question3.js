//Nothing much to explain here, this is all very similar to question 2
let num1 = prompt("Please enter a number.");
let num2 = prompt("Please enter another number.");

//Converts the two prompts to ints so that they can be added together.
let sum = (parseInt(num1) + parseInt(num2));
window.alert("First you entered: " + num1 + "\nThen: " + num2 + "\nAnd the sum is: " + sum);
